# Car Booking System

The car booking system is an online platform that allows users to rent a vehicle for a specific period of time. The system enables users to select a vehicle from a list of available cars, choose the rental period, and make a reservation. Also, they can cancel the reservation and update their profile. The system also includes payment processing which will be calculated automatically by the system. When the booking has been made by the customer, the admin must approve or reject the booking first to avoid clashing with the time rent for a specific car. Other than that, the admin has the authority to add, modify and delete the list of cars. With a car booking system, customers can easily find and book the car of their choice, saving time and effort compared to traditional rental methods. The system also provides an efficient way to manage their car renting business and improve the rental experience for their customers. It really offers a convenient and hassle-free way to rent a vehicle. The system is complete with features like a car inventory counter and password encryption.
